# 0x1D. C - Binary trees 

## About
> C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. This projects covers the concepts of binary trees!

- This repository consists of a project on Binary trees (**low level programming**) done with [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) Full stack Software Engineering course in partnership with [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) by [victorpreston](https://github.com/victorpreston).
